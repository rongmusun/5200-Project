The scatter plot provides a clear visualization of data distribution and potential outliers, with stroke cases marked distinctly. This allows for easy identification of risk patterns based on age and glucose levels. The accompanying histogram offers a deeper look at the distribution of glucose levels, helping to understand the frequency and range of values across the dataset.\n\n\nCode\nfrom pandas.plotting import parallel_coordinates\n\n# Create a parallel coordinates plot with highlighting for 'stroke'\nplt.figure(figsize=(12, 6))\nparallel_coordinates(\n    stroke_data, \n    class_column='stroke', \n    cols=['age', 'avg_glucose_level', 'bmi'], \n    color=['r', 'b'], \n    alpha=0.4\n)\nplt.title('Parallel Coordinates Plot: Attributes by Stroke')\nplt.xlabel('Attributes')\nplt.ylabel('Values')\nplt.grid(True)\nplt.show()  # To display the plot in this environment\n\n\n\n\n\nThe parallel coordinates plot displays multiple attributes (‘age’, ‘avg_glucose_level’, ‘bmi’) for individuals, categorized by stroke occurrence. This visualization is useful for identifying relationships and patterns across several dimensions simultaneously. For example, it can reveal if higher glucose levels and BMI are more common among older individuals or those who have experienced a stroke, thus providing insights into potential risk factors across different demographic segments.\n\n\nCode\nimport networkx as nx\n\n# Create a network graph to represent the relationship between 'work_type' and 'stroke'\nG = nx.Graph()\n\n# Add work_type and stroke as nodes\nfor work_type in stroke_data['work_type'].unique():\n    G.add_node(work_type, label='work_type')\n\nfor stroke in stroke_data['stroke'].unique():\n    G.add_node(stroke, label='stroke')\n\n# Add edges based on the relationships between 'work_type' and 'stroke'\nfor _, row in stroke_data.iterrows():\n    G.add_edge(row['work_type'], row['stroke'])\n\n# Draw the network diagram with a circular layout\nplt.figure(figsize=(8, 8))\npos = nx.circular_layout(G)\nnx.draw(G, pos, with_labels=True, node_size=1500, font_size=12, node_color='skyblue', edge_color='gray')\nplt.title(\"Circular Network Diagram: Work Type and Stroke\")\nplt.show()  # To display the plot in this environment\n\n\n\nThis visualization uses a circular network layout to represent the relationship between different work types and stroke incidence. Each work type is connected to nodes representing the presence or absence of stroke, illustrating how certain professions might correlate with higher or lower stroke risks. This type of diagram is particularly useful for visualizing complex interconnections in a compact and visually appealing manner, facilitating easier pattern recognition and hypothesis generation about occupational health risks.\n\n\nCode\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))\nsns.boxplot(\n    data=stroke_data, \n    x='Residence_type', \n    y='age', \n    palette='pastel'\n)\nplt.title(\"Boxplot: Age Distribution by Residence Type\")\nplt.xlabel(\"Residence Type\")\nplt.ylabel(\"Age\")\nplt.show()  # To display the plot in this environment\n\n\n\n\n\nThe boxplot for ‘age’ distribution by ‘Residence_type’ (urban vs. rural) provides a straightforward comparative analysis of age demographics between different living environments. It highlights the median age, variance, and outliers within each category. This plot is crucial for understanding how age profiles vary in different settings, which can be instrumental in tailoring health interventions or services according to the age structure of populations in urban and rural areas.\n\n\nCode\n# Correlation heatmap to visualize relationships among numerical attributes\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 8))\ncorrelation_matrix = stroke_data[['age', 'avg_glucose_level', 'bmi', 'hypertension', 'heart_disease']].corr()\n\nsns.heatmap(\n    correlation_matrix, \n    annot=True, \n    cmap='coolwarm', \n    fmt='.2f', \n    linewidths=0.5\n).set_title('Heatmap: Correlation Among Numerical Attributes')\n\nplt.show()  # To display the plot in this environment\n\n\n\n\n\nThe heatmap provides a visual representation of the correlation coefficients among various numerical attributes like ‘age’, ‘avg_glucose_level’, ‘bmi’, ‘hypertension’, and ‘heart_disease’. By using color intensity to represent the strength of correlations, the heatmap can quickly reveal important relationships, such as between ‘bmi’ and ‘heart_disease’ or ‘age’ and ‘hypertension’. This type of visualization is particularly valuable for identifying potential risk factors and dependencies that may not be immediately apparent through other analytical methods.\n\n\nCode\nimport plotly.express as px\n\n# Data preparation for the donut chart\nstroke_by_gender = stroke_data.groupby(['gender', 'stroke']).size().reset_index(name='count')\n\n# Create the donut chart to show stroke proportions by gender\nfig_donut = px.pie(\n    stroke_by_gender, \n    values='count', \n    names='gender', \n    hole=0.5, \n    title='Donut Chart: Stroke Proportions by Gender'\n)\n\n# Show the donut chart\nfig_donut.show()  # To display the plot in this environment\n\n\n\n                        \n                                            \n\n\nThis donut chart visualizes the proportion of stroke occurrences by gender in a visually distinct and accessible manner. The hollow center can be used to display additional information or simply focus the viewer’s attention on the proportions. This visualization helps highlight gender differences in stroke prevalence, which can be crucial for medical research and public health initiatives aimed at understanding and addressing gender-specific health risks.\n\n\nCode\n# Create a violin plot to show the distribution of 'bmi' by 'smoking_status'\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))\nsns.violinplot(\n    data=stroke_data, \n    x='smoking_status', \n    y='bmi', \n    palette='muted'\n).set_title(\"Violin Plot: BMI Distribution by Smoking Status\")\nplt.xlabel(\"Smoking Status\")\nplt.ylabel(\"BMI\")\nplt.show()  # To display the plot in this environment\n\n\n\n\n\nThe violin plot provides a detailed view of the distribution of BMI values across different smoking statuses. This plot combines the benefits of a boxplot with a kernel density estimation, showing not only the median and quartiles but also the full distribution of data, which can reveal multiple modes or anomalies. Such insights are essential for understanding how lifestyle choices like smoking could impact body weight and potentially relate to broader health outcomes.\n\n\nCode\n# Create a pairplot to examine relationships among multiple numerical attributes\nplt.figure(figsize=(10, 10))\nsns.pairplot(\n    stroke_data, \n    hue='stroke', \n    vars=['age', 'avg_glucose_level', 'bmi'], \n    palette='coolwarm'\n).fig.suptitle('Pairplot: Relationships Among Numerical Attributes', y=1.02)\n\nplt.show()  # To display the plot in this environment\n\n\n\nThe pairplot creates a matrix of scatter plots for multiple numerical attributes (such as ‘age’, ‘avg_glucose_level’, ‘bmi’), color-coded by stroke occurrence. This comprehensive visualization enables the exploration of pairwise relationships across several dimensions, helping to identify trends and outliers effectively. By examining these scatter plots, researchers can hypothesize about possible interactions between different health indicators and their collective impact on stroke risk, which can guide further statistical analysis or predictive modeling.\n\n\nCode\n# Load the necessary libraries\nlibrary(plotly)\nlibrary(dplyr)\nlibrary(readr)\n\n# Load your dataset\ndata &lt;- read_csv(\"data/stroke_prediction_dataset.csv\")\n\n# Convert Diagnosis to a binary outcome (0 = No Stroke, 1 = Stroke)\ndata$Diagnosis &lt;- ifelse(data$Diagnosis == \"Stroke\", 1, 0)\n\n# Create a summary data frame for count of diagnoses and total observations grouped by Dietary Habits and Alcohol Intake\nsummary_data &lt;- data %&gt;%\n  group_by(DietaryHabits, AlcoholIntake) %&gt;%\n  summarize(Total_Obs = n(),\n            Stroke_Count = sum(Diagnosis), \n            Stroke_Rate = sum(Diagnosis) / n() * 100, \n            .groups = 'drop')\n\n# Create an interactive bubble plot using plotly, using stroke rate as the size of the bubbles\nplot &lt;- plot_ly(summary_data, x = ~DietaryHabits, y = ~AlcoholIntake, size = ~Stroke_Rate,\n                text = ~paste(\"Stroke Count:\", Stroke_Count,\n                              \"&lt;br&gt;Total Observations:\", Total_Obs,\n                              \"&lt;br&gt;Stroke Rate:\", sprintf(\"%.2f%%\", Stroke_Rate),\n                              \"&lt;br&gt;Dietary Habits:\", DietaryHabits, \n                              \"&lt;br&gt;Alcohol Intake:\", AlcoholIntake),\n                type = 'scatter', mode = 'markers',\n                marker = list(color = 'orange', opacity = 0.6, sizemode = 'diameter')) %&gt;%\n  layout(title = \"Interactive Bubble Plot of Stroke Rate by Dietary Habits and Alcohol Intake\",\n         xaxis = list(title = \"Dietary Habits\"),\n         yaxis = list(title = \"Alcohol Intake\"),\n         showlegend = FALSE)\n\n# Display the plot\nplot\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWe developed an interactive bubble plot that illustrating the relationship between dietary habits and alcohol intake in the context of stroke incidence rates. The vertical axis differentiates levels of alcohol consumption, ranging from ‘Never’ to ‘Frequent Drinker,’ while the horizontal axis categorizes individuals by their dietary preferences, such as Gluten-Free, Keto, Non-Vegetarian, Paleo, Pescatarian, Vegan, and Vegetarian. The size of each bubble presumably correlates with the stroke rate, suggesting that certain combinations of diet and drinking habits may influence the likelihood of having a stroke.\nThe plot indicates that frequent alcohol consumers, particularly within certain dietary groups like non-vegetarian and keto, might face a higher stroke risk, presented by larger bubbles in these categories. On the contrary, those who rarely or never consume alcohol show smaller bubbles, suggesting a lower incidence of stroke. Interestingly, the plot also suggests a consistent stroke rate across different levels of alcohol intake for vegan and vegetarian diets, whereas diets like paleo display larger bubbles even at lower levels of alcohol consumption.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(wordcloud)\nlibrary(tm)\nlibrary(RColorBrewer)\n\nstroke_data &lt;- data %&gt;%\n  filter(Diagnosis == 1)\nsymptoms_text &lt;- stroke_data$Symptoms\nsymptoms_text &lt;- na.omit(symptoms_text)\ncorpus &lt;- Corpus(VectorSource(symptoms_text))\ncorpus &lt;- tm_map(corpus, content_transformer(tolower))\ncorpus &lt;- tm_map(corpus, removePunctuation)\ncorpus &lt;- tm_map(corpus, removeNumbers)\ncorpus &lt;- tm_map(corpus, removeWords, stopwords(\"english\"))\ncustom_stopwords &lt;- c(\"symptom\", \"symptoms\")\ncorpus &lt;- tm_map(corpus, removeWords, custom_stopwords)\n\ntdm &lt;- TermDocumentMatrix(corpus)\nm &lt;- as.matrix(tdm)\nword_freqs &lt;- sort(rowSums(m), decreasing = TRUE)\nword_freqs &lt;- data.frame(word = names(word_freqs), freq = word_freqs)\nnum_words &lt;- min(100, nrow(word_freqs))\n\nwordcloud(words = word_freqs$word, freq = word_freqs$freq, scale = c(3, 0.5), \n          max.words = num_words, random.order = FALSE, rot.per = 0.35, \n          colors = colorRampPalette(brewer.pal(9, \"Blues\"))(num_words))\n\n\n\n\n\nWe have created a word cloud to visually represent the range of symptoms commonly reported by stroke patients. This word cloud includes terms like “dizziness,” “headache,” “confusion,” “seizures,” and “weakness,” among others. Notably, all the words in the cloud are of relatively the same size, indicating that these symptoms are reported with similar frequency among stroke patients. The word cloud effectively conveys that while the severity may vary from person to person, the prevalence of each symptom is notably consistent.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(plotly)\n\n# Load the dataset\ndata &lt;- read.csv(\"data/stroke_prediction_dataset.csv\")\n\n# Calculate the total count for each category of Marital Status\ntotal_count &lt;- aggregate(Diagnosis ~ MaritalStatus, data = data, FUN = function(x) sum(x == \"Stroke\"))\n\n# Calculate the proportion of stroke and no-stroke cases for each category of Marital Status and Work Type\nprop_stroke &lt;- aggregate(Diagnosis ~ MaritalStatus + WorkType, data = data, FUN = function(x) sum(x == \"Stroke\"))\n\n# Create a stacked bar chart with count on the y-axis and stroke rate as hover text\nplot_ly(data = prop_stroke, x = ~MaritalStatus, y = ~Diagnosis, color = ~WorkType, type = \"bar\", \n        marker = list(line = list(color = \"black\", width = 0.5)), \n        hoverinfo = \"text\",\n        text = ~paste(\"Marital Status: \", MaritalStatus, \"&lt;br&gt;Work Type: \", WorkType, \n                      \"&lt;br&gt;Stroke Rate: \", sprintf(\"%.2f\", (Diagnosis / total_count$Diagnosis[match(MaritalStatus, total_count$MaritalStatus)]) * 100), \"%\")) %&gt;%\n  layout(title = \"Stroke Rate by Marital Status and Work Type\",\n         xaxis = list(title = \"Marital Status\"),\n         yaxis = list(title = \"Count\"),\n         barmode = \"stack\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe stacked bar chart presents the distribution of stroke rates across different marital statuses and work types. Notably, across all marital statuses, there appears to be a consistent distribution of stroke cases, and it reveals that the stroke rates vary slightly among different combinations of marital status and work type. Across all marital statuses, the stroke rates range from approximately 23.34% to 26.92%. Interestingly, there is no significant disparity in stroke rates between the marital statuses of divorced, married, and single individuals. However, within each marital status, variations in stroke rates are observed across different work types. For instance, among divorced individuals, the self-employed have the highest stroke rate at 26.17%, while those who never worked exhibit the lowest rate at 23.99%. Similarly, for married and single individuals, there are subtle differences in stroke rates across various work types. This suggests that while marital status may not be a significant factor influencing stroke risk, the nature of one’s occupation might play a role. Further investigation into the specific occupational hazards and lifestyle factors associated with each work type could provide valuable insights into understanding these variations in stroke rates.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(plotly)\n\n# Load the dataset\ndata &lt;- read.csv(\"data/stroke_prediction_dataset.csv\")\n\n# Create a bubble chart with adjusted bubble size\nplot_ly(data, x = ~BMI, y = ~AverageGlucoseLevel, size = ~I(StressLevels), color = ~Diagnosis, \n        colors = c(\"blue\", \"red\"), type = \"scatter\", mode = \"markers\", \n        hoverinfo = \"text\",\n        text = ~paste(\"&lt;br&gt;Body Mass Index (BMI): \", BMI, \"&lt;br&gt;Average Glucose Level: \", AverageGlucoseLevel, \n                      \"&lt;br&gt;Stress Levels: \", StressLevels, \"&lt;br&gt;Diagnosis: \", Diagnosis)) %&gt;%\n  layout(title = \"Bubble Chart: BMI vs Average Glucose Level\",\n         xaxis = list(title = \"BMI\"),\n         yaxis = list(title = \"Average Glucose Level\"),\n         showlegend = TRUE,\n         legend = list(title = \"Diagnosis\"))\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe bubble plot illustrates the relationship between Body Mass Index (BMI) and Average Glucose Level, with the size of each bubble representing Stress Levels and the color denoting the diagnosis status of the individuals in the dataset. The plot reveals several insights. First, there is a noticeable dispersion of data points across different BMI and glucose level ranges, indicating vacoriability in stress levels among the individuals. Additionally, bubbles of different sizes highlight the varying levels of stress experienced by the individuals, with larger bubbles representing higher stress levels. The color contrast between blue and red bubbles distinguishes between stroke and non-stroke cases, allowing for easy identification of trends. Upon analyzing the plot, it’s evident that areas with higher BMI, elevated average glucose levels, and increased stress levels are associated with a higher incidence of stroke. This observation aligns with existing medical knowledge that highlights the correlation between these factors and the risk of stroke. This suggests that individuals with these characteristics may have an increased risk of experiencing a stroke. Therefore, it’s crucial for healthcare practitioners to consider these factors when assessing stroke risk and implementing preventive measures."

    "text": "The dashboard is constructed using HTML components and is an instance of a Dash application. Each HTML.Div contains a graph, and our dashboard displays a total of four interactive charts.\nFirst, we present a scatter plot that explores the relationship between age and BMI. This chart illustrates how age and BMI are associated with stroke history. (You might want to analyze a few data points to discuss their specific age, BMI, and stroke risk.)\nNext, we use a bar chart to demonstrate the distribution of stroke occurrences across different genders. This visual allows us to easily compare the differences in stroke risk between genders.\nAdditionally, our application includes a heatmap that shows the connection between high blood pressure, heart disease, and stroke history.\nFinally, we display a 3D scatter plot that combines the three dimensions of average glucose level, BMI, and age, with color representing stroke history. This plot clearly shows the impact of these three features on the risk of stroke.\n\n\nCode\nimport dash\nfrom dash import html, dcc, Input, Output, ctx\nimport plotly.express as px\nimport pandas as pd\n\nimport warnings\nwarnings.filterwarnings('ignore')\n\n# Load dataset\ndf = pd.read_csv('stroke_prediction_dataset.csv')\n\n# Initialize the Dash app\napp = dash.Dash(__name__)\n\n# App layout\napp.layout = html.Div([\n    html.H1(\"Stroke Risk Data Visualization\", style={'text-align': 'center'}),\n\n    # Age vs. BMI Scatter Plot\n    html.Div([\n        html.H2(\"Age vs. BMI Scatter Plot\"),\n        dcc.Graph(id='age-bmi-scatter'),\n    ]),\n\n    # Gender Distribution with Stroke Occurrence\n    html.Div([\n        html.H2(\"Gender Distribution with Stroke Occurrence\"),\n        dcc.Graph(id='gender-distribution'),\n    ]),\n\n    # Hypertension and Heart Disease Heatmap\n    html.Div([\n        html.H2(\"Hypertension and Heart Disease Heatmap\"),\n        dcc.Graph(id='hypertension-heatmap'),\n    ]),\n\n    # Average Glucose Level vs. BMI 3D Scatter Plot\n    html.Div([\n        html.H2(\"Average Glucose Level vs. BMI 3D Scatter Plot\"),\n        dcc.Graph(id='glucose-bmi-3d-scatter'),\n    ]),\n])\n\n\n# Callbacks for interactive components\n@app.callback(\n    Output('age-bmi-scatter', 'figure'),\n    Input('age-bmi-scatter', 'id')  # Just a trigger to load the plot\n)\ndef update_age_bmi_scatter(_):\n    fig = px.scatter(df, x='Age', y='Body Mass Index (BMI)', color='Stroke History',\n                     title=\"Relationship Between Age and BMI Across Stroke History\")\n    return fig\n\n\n@app.callback(\n    Output('gender-distribution', 'figure'),\n    Input('gender-distribution', 'id')  # Just a trigger to load the plot\n)\ndef update_gender_distribution(_):\n    stroke_df = df.groupby(['Gender', 'Stroke History']).size().reset_index(name='counts')\n    fig = px.bar(stroke_df, x='Gender', y='counts', color='Stroke History',\n                 title=\"Stroke Occurrence by Gender\")\n    return fig\n\n\n@app.callback(\n    Output('hypertension-heatmap', 'figure'),\n    Input('hypertension-heatmap', 'id')  # Just a trigger to load the plot\n)\ndef update_hypertension_heatmap(_):\n    heatmap_data = df.groupby(['Hypertension', 'Heart Disease', 'Stroke History']).size().unstack().fillna(0)\n    fig = px.imshow(heatmap_data, text_auto=True,\n                    labels=dict(x=\"Heart Disease\", y=\"Hypertension\", color=\"Count\"),\n                    title=\"Correlation Heatmap of Hypertension, Heart Disease, and Stroke\")\n    return fig\n\n\n@app.callback(\n    Output('glucose-bmi-3d-scatter', 'figure'),\n    Input('glucose-bmi-3d-scatter', 'id')  # Just a trigger to load the plot\n)\ndef update_glucose_bmi_3d_scatter(_):\n    fig = px.scatter_3d(df, x='Average Glucose Level', y='Body Mass Index (BMI)', z='Age',\n                        color='Stroke History',\n                        title=\"3D Plot of Glucose, BMI, and Age with Stroke History\")\n    return fig\n\n\n# Run the application\nif __name__ == '__main__':\n    app.run_server(debug=True)\n\n\nDashboard"

    "text": "Stroke, also called a “brain attack,” occurs when blood flow to the brain is blocked or there is sudden bleeding in the brain(NIH 2023). This interruption can cause lasting brain damage, long-term disability, or even death. Stroke is a serious medical condition that requires emergency care, and it is one of the world’s leading causes of death and disability. Stroke analysis is an integral part of modern healthcare, as early recognition of symptoms can provide critical information for predicting strokes and promoting a healthy lifestyle(Dritsas and Trigka 2022).\nMoreover, since strokes are both preventable and treatable(CDC Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 2023), individuals can significantly reduce their risk by modifying their daily habits. Simple changes like improving diet, increasing physical activity, and managing stress can have a huge impact on stroke prevention(American Stroke Association 2022).\nBy analyzing and visually presenting the characteristics of groups of stroke patients to others, even those without a medical background can gain a clear understanding of the risk factors associated with strokes. This approach not only helps in recognizing the lifestyle and environmental factors that contribute to strokes, but also allows individuals to identify and alter their behaviors that may increase the risk of stroke(Zheng, Chen, and Sawan 2022; “Risk Factors, Clinical Presentations, and Predictors of Stroke Among Adult Patients” 2022; “Using Machine Learning Models to Improve Stroke Risk Level Classification Methods” 2022; “Stroke Risk Prediction with Machine Learning Techniques” 2022). This awareness and intervention can substantially reduce the chances of suffering a stroke, enhancing both individual and public health.\n\n\n\n\nReferences\n\nAmerican Stroke Association. 2022. “Stroke Risk Factors.” https://www.stroke.org/en/about-stroke/stroke-risk-factors.\n\n\nCDC Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. 2023. “About Stroke.” https://www.cdc.gov/stroke/index.htm.\n\n\nDritsas, E., and M.

    "text": "In our comprehensive analysis of stroke risk based on a meticulously curated dataset comprising various personal and medical attributes of patients, we successfully developed a series of visualizations that provide significant insights into key health indicators and their interactions. These insights are instrumental in understanding the complex dynamics of stroke risk factors and offer a robust foundation for targeted intervention strategies and healthcare planning.\nThrough our exploratory data analysis, we were able to highlight significant patterns and disparities in stroke incidence across different demographic groups. This analysis not only underscored the importance of individual risk factors, such as age, gender, BMI, and glucose levels, but also revealed how these factors interplay with social determinants like marital status, work type, and residence. For instance, we identified certain professions and lifestyles associated with higher stroke risks, which could be due to varying stress levels, physical demands, or differential access to healthcare resources.\nOur project employed advanced statistical tools to delve into the relationships between medical indicators such as hypertension, heart disease, and body mass index, and their collective impact on stroke occurrence. This rigorous analytical approach allowed us to pinpoint which factors are most strongly correlated with stroke, providing a data-driven basis for preventive measures. Furthermore, the use of machine learning techniques enabled us to predict stroke risk with significant accuracy, thus opening the door to personalized medical recommendations and proactive health management.\nOne of the pivotal achievements of this project was the development of interactive and engaging visual narratives that effectively communicate complex data insights to a general audience. These narratives not only foster a deeper understanding of stroke risk factors but also enhance the audience’s ability to make informed health decisions. By integrating interactivity into our visualizations, we facilitated a more personalized exploration of the data, allowing individuals to see how specific changes in lifestyle or health metrics could alter their personal stroke risk.\nMoreover, our visualizations served an educational purpose, incrementally building the viewer’s understanding of stroke risks from fundamental concepts to more detailed and specific information. This educational approach ensures that the information is accessible to individuals with varying levels of health literacy, thereby broadening the impact of our findings.\nIn conclusion, the visualizations and analyses conducted as part of this project not only provide valuable insights into stroke prevention but also demonstrate the power of data visualization in public health. They highlight the critical role that data-driven strategies can play in enhancing healthcare delivery and disease prevention. Our findings advocate for the integration of personalized health data into preventive health strategies, emphasizing the need for a multifaceted approach to health management and education. The project stands as a testament to how visual data storytelling can bridge the gap between complex data analysis and practical, actionable health insights, ultimately fostering a more informed and health-conscious society."
